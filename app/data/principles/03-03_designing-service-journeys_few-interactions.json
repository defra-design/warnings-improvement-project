		"guidanceText01": "The number of times a person has to interact with a service to acheive their goals is important when considering and reducing the overall carbon impact. For example, each visit to a webpage generates energy usage costs from page loading and data transfer. Each in-person visit to a physical location could have even larger energy consumption associated.",
		"guidanceText02": "Design so that people can complete their goals with as few interactions as possible, for example through a single visit to a webpage or a single phone call. This will help to make sure energy consumption is kept to a minimum. If switching between channels does happen, make sure this is as smooth as possible (such as not involving re-entering of information they have already provided). This should help to reduce energy consumption."
