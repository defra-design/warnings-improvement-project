                When a severe flood warning is issued there is a danger to life and a risk of major disruption.</p>

              <p><b>Flood warnings</b><br>
                When a flood warning is issued immediate action is needed. There is a risk of flooding to homes, businesses, rail and roads.</p>

                <p><b>Flood alerts</b><br>
                Flood alerts warn that flooding may be possible. They are usually issued from two days to two hours before flooding might happen. Alerts can help you be prepared to act on your flood plan.</p>
