      <p>
        Flood risk is based on combination of likelihood and impact - how likely it is that flooding will happen and
        the effect that will have on people, building and services.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">High risk</p>
      <p>High risk means that each year there is a chance of flooding from rivers and the sea of greater than 1 in
        30</p>


      <p class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Medium risk</p>
      <p>Medium risk means that each year there is a chance of flooding from rivers and the sea of between 1 in 100
        and 1 in 30</p>

      <p class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Low risk</p>
      <p>Low risk means that each year there is a chance of flooding from rivers and the sea of between 1 in 1000
        and 1 in 100</p>

      <p class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Possible</p>
      <p>Possible means that flooding is possible in the local area when groundwater levels are high</p>

      <p class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Unlikely</p>
      <p>Unlikely meant it is unlikely your location will be affected by groundwater flooding</p>
