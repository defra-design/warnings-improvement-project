<p>Your location may be in a place where:</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>flood warnings and severe flood warnings are issued (flood warning area)</li>
<li>flood alerts are issued (flood alert area)</li>
<li>flood warnings, severe flood warnings and flood alerts are issued (where your location is in both a flood warning area and a flood alert area)

    <p><b>Severe flood warnings</b><br>
    When a severe flood warning is issued there is a danger to life and a risk of major disruption.</p>

  <p><b>Flood warnings</b><br>
    When a flood warning is issued immediate action is needed. There is a risk of flooding to homes, businesses, rail and roads.</p>

    <p><b>Flood alerts</b><br>
    Flood alerts warn that flooding may be possible. They are usually issued from two days to two hours before flooding might happen. Alerts can help you be prepared to act on your flood plan.</p>

    Flood warning areas
</h2>


<p>The Environment Agency monitors many areas across England and can issue flood warnings and severe flood warnings when flooding is expected. These are called flood warning areas.</p>

<p>Flood warning areas usually cover smaller, more specific areas where people live or work, such as cities, towns, villages or hamlets.</p>

<p>Not all locations are in places where flood warnings and severe flood warnings are issued.</p>


<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    Your locations may still be at risk even if there is no warning service for that area.

    Flood alert areas
</h2>

<p>Flood alert areas tend to be larger and less specific than flood warning areas. They can cross several flood warning areas.</p>

<p>Flood alerts are issued earlier than flood warnings to provide advance notice of the possibility of flooding. They may be issued when there is less confidence that flooding will happen.</p>

<p>Not all locations are in places where flood alerts are issued.</p>

    <img class="defra-flood-heading-image" src="/public/images/flood-extent.svg" width="46" height="46" style="vertical-align: middle" alt="">
    Flood extent and flood risk
</h2>

<p>Flood extent predicts the area of the flood that could happen at a particular location.</p>

<p>Flood risk is based on a combination of likelihood and impact – how likely it is that flooding will happen and the effect that will have on people, buildings and services.</p>
